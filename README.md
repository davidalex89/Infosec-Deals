# Ongoing Infosec and Black Friday deals for 2023
Started doing this a few years ago for Black Friday discounts for Security professionals and developers.
No affiliate codes or anything, just good deals I've found.

I haven't had a chance to update everything here, but there's 0x90n has a more comprehensive and up-to-date list here:
